The departments at Vanderbilt all have their own schedules of lectures/seminars given by that department. This app will combine data from all departments to create a calendar containing all lectures/seminars to provide a more convenient way to view all lectures/seminars given at Vanderbilt. The user will be able to save preferences, such as favorite topics and favorite times for lectures/seminars (perhaps adding notifications for favorites), in order to provide a better user experience.
